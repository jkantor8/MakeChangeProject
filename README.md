# MakeChangeProject

# Description

This project is a cash register program that calculates the change to be returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. It also notifies the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20, $10, $5, $1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. The program uses the largest bill and coin denominations as possible and does not display denominations that are not used.

# Lessons Learned 

 I learned how to use the modulus operator to calculate the remainder of a division operation while simultaneously casting a double value to an integer value using the (int) operator. This is useful when I want to ignore the decimal places and only work with the whole number part of a decimal value. I also learned the importance of paying attention to rounding errors when working with decimal values, and how to use Math.round method to round a number to the nearest whole number.
